# MLB Hitter Modeling

## -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective

This repository hosts various piece of work in the steps to build a fully working MLB player model similar to ZIPS. Various expoloratory steps need to be taken first before the model is made.

## Roadmap

### Broad Steps to be taken

- Exploring aging curves for the various stats of intrest
- Use K-Nearest Neighbor to find similar seasons and compare outcomes
- Devlop XGBoost model to predict median outcome for each player season
- Determine unqiue standard dev for each player season
- Use a Monte Carlo simulation to capture such std
